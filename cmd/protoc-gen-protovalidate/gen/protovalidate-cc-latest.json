	"body": "Adds support for CMake. CMake support is still considered somewhat experimental, but should be usable for embedding protovalidate-cc into projects. For more information about how to use protovalidate with CMake, check the [README information](https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-cc/tree/main/cmake#readme).\r\n\r\nBazel 8 is now also supported, but it requires `WORKSPACE` mode to be enabled.
