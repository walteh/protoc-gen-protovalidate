	"body": "## What's Changed\r\nThis release fixes several bugs, including some edge cases involving `IGNORE_ALWAYS` and the memory usage increase that was introduced in protovalidate-go v0.9.1. In addition, it introduces `GlobalValidator` (https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/216) and `Filter` (https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/185).\r\n\r\nUsing the `Filter` API, it is possible to entirely ignore rules on a specific message, field or oneof, or only consider rules on specific messages, fields and oneofs. Using the `GlobalValidator` API, it is easier for libraries to both accept a user-provided `Validator` instance while defaulting to the global `Validator` instance, reducing memory usage.\r\n\r\n\u003e [!NOTE]\r\n\u003e While we strive to not break the API unnecessarily, protovalidate-go is still considered unstable and APIs may still potentially change in backwards incompatible ways in the future until v1.0, hopefully very infrequently. In particular, the `Filter` API is still under active consideration.\r\n\r\nSeveral dependencies are updated.\r\n\r\n* Bump buf.build/gen/go/bufbuild/protovalidate/protocolbuffers/go from 1.36.5-20250130201111-63bb56e20495.1 to 1.36.5-20250219170025-d39267d9df8f.1 in the go group by @dependabot in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/192\r\n* Implement Filter interface by @jchadwick-buf in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/185\r\n* Ignore all rules with IGNORE_ALWAYS by @timostamm in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/197\r\n* Bump github.com/google/cel-go from 0.23.2 to 0.24.1 in the go group by @dependabot in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/196\r\n* Bump CI Go version to include 1.24.x + golangci-lint to 1.64.5 by @rodaine in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/198\r\n* Handle compilation error by @doriable in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/205\r\n* Update go deps + codegen by @rodaine in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/210\r\n* Allow overriding now variable in CEL expressions by @rodaine in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/212\r\n* Avoid per-field cel environments when possible by @jchadwick-buf in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/195\r\n* Prepare GitHub docs for shift to buf.build/docs by @jrinehart-buf in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/194\r\n* Expose a `GlobalValidator` instance by @jchadwick-buf in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/216\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @doriable made their first contribution in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/205\r\n* @jrinehart-buf made their first contribution in https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/pull/194\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bufbuild/protovalidate-go/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.3",
