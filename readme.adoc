= protoc-gen-protovalidate

[IMPORTANT]
====
This project extends the functionality of the `bufbuild/protovalidate-go` repository by integrating validation code generation directly into the Protobuf compilation workflow.
====

== What is protoc-gen-protovalidate?

`protoc-gen-protovalidate` is a Protobuf compiler plugin that allows you to generate validation code as part of your normal `protoc` workflow. It takes validation constraints defined in your `.proto` files and generates the corresponding validation code that can be used directly in your application.

What makes this tool unique is that it rewrites the imported validation code from `bufbuild/protovalidate-go` to use *your project's package paths*, ensuring seamless integration without dependency conflicts.

== The Problem It Solves

When using the standard `bufbuild/protovalidate-go` library for validating Protocol Buffer messages:

1. The validation code sits outside your project's normal build process
2. You need to maintain consistent versions between your Protobuf definitions and the validation library
3. Import path conflicts can arise between the validation code and your application
4. Dependency management becomes more complex

`protoc-gen-protovalidate` elegantly solves these issues by:

* **Direct Integration**: Generating validation code directly within your protoc compilation pipeline
* **Path Rewriting**: Automatically adjusting import paths to match your project structure
* **Synchronized Versioning**: Maintaining version alignment between validation code and your Protobuf schemas
* **Simplified Dependencies**: Embedding the necessary validation code in your project, reducing external dependencies
* **Local Control**: Giving you full control over when and how validation code is updated

== How It Works

`protoc-gen-protovalidate` works by:

1. Downloading the validation code from the `bufbuild/protovalidate-go` repository (either from a specific release or using bundled code)
2. Modifying the import paths to match your project structure
3. Generating the validation code as part of your protoc compilation
4. Placing the generated code in your project alongside other generated protobuf code

== Quickstart Configuration

Add the following to your `buf.gen.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - out: gen/proto/golang
    local: ["go", "tool", "github.com/walteh/protoc-gen-protovalidate/cmd/protoc-gen-protovalidate"]
    include_imports: true
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - buf_validate_file=path/to/your/validate.proto (only needed if you are not using the default `buf/validate/validate.proto`)
----

For an example implementation, you can look at https://github.com/walteh/cloudstack-proxy.

=== Configuration Options

* `buf_validate_file`: Path to your validate.proto file (default: "buf/validate/validate.proto")
* `language`: Target language for validation code (default: "go") 
* `protovalidate_ref`: Version reference for protovalidate code (default: "_local")

== Supported Languages

Currently, `protoc-gen-protovalidate` fully supports Go, with plans to support:

* Python
* C++
* Java

Enjoy simplified, integrated Protobuf validation!
